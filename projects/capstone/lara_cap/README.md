# Machine Lerning Engineer Nanodegree
## Unsupervised Learning

## Project: Clusters by use of time
 
### Install
This project requiers**Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Pylab
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
Template code is provided in the `The_clusters.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the `the_data.csv`and `big_data.csv` dataset files to complete your work. The `atus_data_cleanup.ipynb` was used to clean up, rename and manually merge some data and the `data_basic_vis.ipynb` describes the data visually. 

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `lara_cap/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook ´The_clusters.ipynb´
or

jupyter notebook `The_clusters.ipynb`
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
